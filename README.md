</p>

The task is only to implement this diagram and write two players. <br>
Gameplay: collect all the food which will randomly spawn on the map. <br>
There are several ways to create a map:
1. Choose the file from open dialog
2. Get map file path from the console arguments
3. Randomly create a maze-like map file and load from it

There's two types of player <br>
**Actual player**
* Can be controlled using keybord's arrows or "wasd"
* Speed is limitted only by your own

**Bot player**
* Searching the shortest path to the food
* Speed depends on how far is the food

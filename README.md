# Eater
SDU's Programming Technologies project

## Purpose
Create pacman-like game using Java SE + JavaFX

## Creating process
Students had ready class diagram:
![alt]("res/Class diagram.jpg")
The task is only to implement this diagram and write two players.
Gameplay: collect all the food which will randomly spawn on the map.
There are several ways to create a map.
<ol>
    <li>Choose the file from open dialog</li>
    <li>Get map file path from the console arguments</li>
    <li>Randomly create a maze-like map file and load from it</li>
</ol>

There's two types of player
**Actual player**
<ol>
    <li>Can be controlled using keybord's arrows or "wasd"</li>
    <li>Speed is limitted only by your own</li>
</ol>

**Bot player**
<ol>
    <li>Searching the shortest path to the food</li>
    <li>Speed depends on how far is the food</li>
</ol>
